    <p>Today, the women of World Pulse's growing network (60,000 strong from 190+
      countries) are improving over 2.2 million lives. With new recognition, awards,
      and exponentially increasing impact, World Pulse is one step closer to
      facilitating a digital vocal uprising for global transformation powered by
      millions of women on the ground from every region of the world.</p>

    <h2>Leading in the Technology Sector</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>World Pulse played a key role in a groundbreaking report called <em>Women
        and the Web</em></li>

      <li>In recognition of our innovative approach using technology to empower
        women, World Pulse was awarded a Next Century Innovator Rockefeller award.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>So, What's Next?</h2>

    <h3>Community Powered and Community Led</h3>

    <p>In 2014, we will continue the exciting process of building the technical
    infrastructure needed to reach and sustain a vocal, online community of
    millions of women speaking for themselves. We will continue to grow our
    online community leadership roles and preserve the safe, supporting culture
    that enables a critical mass of women on the ground to manage, lead, and
    grow our network. We believe this is true sustainability and
    scalability.</p>

    <blockquote>When I first heard about the World Pulse website I ran home to
      check it out. I felt like was in a country where all the ladies are rulers
      and our defense forces are the voices of girls around the globe. World Pulse
      is different from all the other websites, connecting women so they can work
      on a massive level. Once I thought, 'Why nobody change the things?' Then
      I realized, why can't that nobody be me?" <cite>—Mahrukh Pasha, Pakistan</cite></blockquote>
